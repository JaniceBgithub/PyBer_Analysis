# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Pandas and matplotlib was used to create a dataframe summarizing ride sharing information by city type. A multiple line graph was cdreated showing the total weekly fares for each cicty type. 

## Results

### Ride sharing data overview (scatterplot)

The cirlce size relates to the number of drivers in the city. 

![overview](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig1.png)

Results: 
- The urban cities have the most drivers, followed by suburban and rural
- Number of rides is higher in urban areas, but fares are low.  The opposite is true for rural.  Suburban is in the middle on both parameters. 

### Number of rides by city type (boxplot)

![box_rides](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig2.png)

Results: 
- Similar data is presented in a boxplot
- There is one outlier in the data - West Angela has the highest ride count

###  Fare data by city type (boxplot)

![fare_data](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig3.png)

Results: 
- Rural cities have a higher average fare and a much wider range in the data

### Driver count by city type (boxplot)

![driver_count](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig4.png)

Results: 
- The urban region has a higher average number of drivers per city and a much higher range in suburban and rural 

### Fares by city type (pie chart)

![Pie_1](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/fig5.png)

Results: 
- The urban region dominates in fares with 62.7% of total fares
- Rural makes up a small fraction of revenue at 6.8%

### Rides by city type (pie chart)

![rides_city_type](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/fig6.png)

Results: 
- Urban cities account for 68.4% of rides; the portion of fares for the urban cities is lower than the number of rides due to more lower-fare rides in the urban region 

### Drivers by city type (pie chart)

![drivers](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/fig7.png)

Results: 
- Drivers from the urban cities make up a dominant fraction of total drivers
- Rural cities only account for 0.8% of total drivers
