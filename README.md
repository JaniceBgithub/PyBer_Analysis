# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Pandas and matplotlib was used to create a dataframe summarizing ride sharing information by city type. A multiple line graph was cdreated showing the total weekly fares for each cicty type. 

## Results

### Ride sharing data overview (scatterplot)

The cirlce size relates to the number of drivers in the city. 

![overview](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig1.png)

Results: 
- The urban cities have the most drivers, followed by suburban and rural
- Number of rides is higher in urban areas, but fares are low.  The opposite is true for rural.  Suburban is in the middle on both parameters. 

### Number of rides by city type (boxplot)

![box_rides](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig2.png)

Results: 
- Similar data is presented in a boxplot
- There is one outlier in the data - West Angela has the highest ride count

###  Fare data by city type (boxplot)

![fare_data](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig3.png)

Results: 
- Rural cities have a higher average fare and a much wider range in the data


### Driver count by city type (boxplot)

![driver_count](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig4.png)

Results: 
- The urban region has a higher average number of drivers per city and a much higher range in suburban and rural 

### Fares by city type (pie chart)

![Pie_1](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/fig5.png)

Results: 
- The urban region dominates in fares with 62.7% of total fares
- Rural makes up a small fraction of revenue at 6.8%

### Rides by city type (pie chart)

![rides_city_type](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/fig6.png)

Results: 
- Urban cities account for 68.4% of rides; the portion of fares for the urban cities is lower than the number of rides due to more lower-fare rides in the urban region 

### Drivers by city type (pie chart)

![drivers](https://github.com/JaniceBgithub/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/fig7.png)

Results: 
- Drivers from the urban cities make up a dominant fraction of total drivers
- Rural cities only account for 0.8% of total drivers

## Recommendations

1. Driver count and portion of rides from rural regions are extremely low.  The rural region tends to have higher-value rides.  Therfore PyBer may want to market more to the rural areas and increase drivers and riders. 

2. There may be too many drivers in the urban area - they make up 87% of drivers but 63% of fares.  PyBer may want to limit drivers in some urban cities so that the existing drivers can make more money. 

3. PyBer may want to consider reducing rural city fares to encourage more riders.
